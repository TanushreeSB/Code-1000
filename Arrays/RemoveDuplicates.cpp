/*
Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

If there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of the array should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

Note: Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of the array.

If arr[j] != arr[i], increase ‘i’ and update arr[i] == arr[j].
 After completion of the loop return i+1, i.e size of the array of unique elements.
