/*

Why start % letters.size()?
Letâ€™s say:

After binary search, start points to the first character that is greater than target.

But what if all characters are less than or equal to target?

In that case, start == letters.size() (i.e., we go past the last index).

So we do start % letters.size() to wrap around to index 0 and return the first letter.
