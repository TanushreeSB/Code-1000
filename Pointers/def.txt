- A pointer however, is a variable that stores the memory address as its value.

- A pointer variable points to a data type (like int or string) of the same type, and is created with the * operator. 
  
- The address of the variable you're working with is assigned to the pointer:

- we used the pointer variable to get the memory address of a variable (used together with the & reference operator). However, you can also use the pointer to get the value of the variable, by using the * operator (the dereference operator):
string food = "Pizza";  // Variable declaration
string* ptr = &food;    // Pointer declaration

// Reference: Output the memory address of food with the pointer (0x6dfed4)
cout << ptr << "\n";

// Dereference: Output the value of food with the pointer (Pizza)
cout << *ptr << "\n";
