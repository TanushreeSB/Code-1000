 Binary Search on Columns
We apply binary search on columns to reduce time complexity to O(m Ã— log n).

ðŸ’¡ Intuition:
Instead of checking all elements (brute force), we pick a middle column, find the max element in that column, and check its left/right neighbors. Based on which side is larger, we move in that direction â€” similar to 1D binary search.

âœ¨ Algorithm Steps:
Set left = 0, right = n-1.

While left <= right:

Find mid = (left + right)/2.

For column mid, find the row index maxRow where the element is maximum in this column.

Check neighbors:

If mat[maxRow][mid] is greater than both its left and right neighbors â†’ it's a peak.

If left neighbor is greater â†’ move right = mid - 1.

If right neighbor is greater â†’ move left = mid + 1.

Return [maxRow, mid].
